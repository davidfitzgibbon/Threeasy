<Page title="Importing Models">
  <Markdown>
    At present only GLTF is supported To import a model you need to follow the
    same preload routine as with a texture. However, as with a regular ThreeJS
    project, we need to import the GLTFLoader. Passing this in the settings
    object to Threeasy will have it set up all your loading needs.
