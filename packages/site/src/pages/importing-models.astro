<Page title="Importing Models">
	<Markdown>
		At present only GLTF is supported To import a model you need to follow the
		same preload routine as with a texture. However, as with a regular ThreeJS
		project, we need to import the GLTFLoader. Passing this in the settings
		object to Threeasy will have it set up all your loading needs.
