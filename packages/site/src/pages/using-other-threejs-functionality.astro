    This is getting more advanced, but anything you can do with ThreeJS you can
    do with Threeasy, because Threeasy is just ThreeJS loaded a particular way.
    For example if you wanted to use `OrbitControls`, you just need to
    instantiate them as normal, you just need to remember that the `Camera` and
    `Renderer` are on the `app` variable.
