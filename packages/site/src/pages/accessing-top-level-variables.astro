<Page title="Accessing top level ThreeJS variables">
  <Markdown>
    Seasoned ThreeJS users might be wondering how to access top level ThreeJS
    variables, like `Scene`, `Camera` and `Renderer`. These variables are all
    still in place, there's just attached to the `app` variable. EG to change
    the `Scene` background color from the default black, to `dodgerblue`, and to
    move the `Camera` back and up, you can access from the `app` variable and
    use them as normal. Advanced users should `console.log(app)` and see what's
    going on under the hood.
