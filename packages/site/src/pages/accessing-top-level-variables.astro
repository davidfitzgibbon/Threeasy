<Page title="Accessing top level ThreeJS variables">
  <Markdown>
    Seasoned ThreeJS users might be wondering how to access top level ThreeJS variables, like `Scene`, `Camera` and
    `Renderer`.

    These variables are all still in place, there's just attached to the `app` variable.

    EG to change the `Scene` background color from the default black, to `dodgerblue`, and to move the `Camera` back and
    up, you can access from the `app` variable and use them as normal.

    Advanced users should `console.log(app)` and see what's going on under the hood.
