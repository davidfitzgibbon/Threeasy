<Page title="Importing Textures">
  <Markdown>
    Threeasy automatically sets up a loading manager for you. All you need to do
    is pass a list of textures you want to `preload` as an object. To use those
    functions you need to work inside of a function passed to `postload`.
    There's a big trade-off here admittedly. I'm not sure that this is any less
    confusing than importing a texture in plain ThreeJS. However, it does avoid
    the awkward nesting issues of when / where to run a loader vs the animation
    loop.
