		Threeasy is a wrapper around ThreeJS that lets you get set up fast, so you can get making things quicker!

		## Quick start

		You can follow the [quick start](/quick-start), or jump into the [examples](/examples).

		## How does Threeasy work?

		Threeasy wraps around ThreeJS doing all the boilerplate setup for you. It sets up and tidies away `Scene`, `Camera`,
		`Renderer`, and animations for you. That means that new users have less distractions as the learn, and advanced
		users can just get going quicker!


		How much quicker is it? Here's everything you need to get a static cube on screen.

		<Demo title="Basic Threeasy App" url="basic-threeasy">
			<Code code={code} lang="js" />
		</Demo>


		What we've done here is initialised a new instance of `Threeasy`. This immediately set up the following for you.

		- `Scene`
		- `Renderer`
		- `Camera`
		- `Light`
		- Animation Loop
		- Loading Manager
		- Resizing watcher

		Then we set up a `material`, `geometry` and `mesh`, just like we normally would in ThreeJS. Then we add the mesh to
		the `Scene`, which has been passed to us by Threeast as part of the `app` variable.
